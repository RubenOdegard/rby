From grasping the intricacies of C and understanding some of the 'magic' in higher-level languages, to gradually coding in Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript â€“ some languages brought a new dimension to my toolkit, while others were a nice repitition on already known fundamentals. I sharpened my skills in data structures and algorithms, navigating through arrays, linked lists, and trees. Problem sets challenged me to think critically, solving puzzles that ranged from basic algorithms to complex web development. To sum it up, CS50x is a crash course in programming languages, algorithms, and problem-solving, and it delivered to my expectations. If you are interested in the code, check out the Github repo.",
